===================

> A WebdriverIO plugin. Report results in junit xml format.

![WDIO JUnit Reporter](http://webdriver.io/images/jenkins-final.png "Dot Reporter")

## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `wdio-junit-reporter` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "wdio-junit-reporter": "~0.0.1"
  }
}
```

You can simple do it by:

```bash
npm install wdio-junit-reporter --save-dev
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html).

## Configuration

Following code shows the default wdio test runner configuration. Just add `'junit'` as reporter
to the array. To get some output during the test you can run the [WDIO Dot Reporter](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-dot-reporter) and the WDIO JUnit Reporter at the same time:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'junit'],
  reporterOptions: {
    outputDir: './',
    outputFileFormat: function(opts) { // optional... will default to 'WDIO.xunit${capabilities.sanitizedCapabilities}.${cid}.xml'
        return `results-${opts.cid}.${opts.capabilities}.xml`
    },
    suiteNameFormat: /[^a-z]+/ // optional... will default to /[^a-z0-9]+/
  },
  // ...
};
```
You can break out packages by an additional level by setting `'packageName'` in the config. For example, if you wanted to iterate over a test suite with different environment variable set:

```js
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'junit'],
  reporterOptions: {
    showDiff: true,
    outputDir: './',
    packageName: process.env.USER_ROLE // chrome.41 - administrator
  }
  // ...
```



Last but not least you nead to tell your CI job (e.g. Jenkins) where it can find the xml file. To do that add a post-build action to your job that gets executed after the test has run and point Jenkins (or your desired CI system) to your XML test results:

If there is no such post-build step in your CI system there is probably a plugin for that somewhere on the internet.
